## Setup Server

This document describes how to set up the server for the project.

### Prerequisites
- MySQL server
- Visual Studio or Rider for compiling 
- NetCore 
- Know how to properly setup a Matrix Online Client to connect to any server

# Installation Steps
Compile the solution. 

Copy the data folder to the output directory (where the hds.exe is located).
The Dataloader is searching for files inside it so this is important.

If you have no config.xml in your output folder copy it from docs folder. 
Adjust your database values to your needs. 

# Running locally
To connect to your local server, you might need to setup hosts and useropts.cfg options.

ToDo: this needs to be documented better in the future.
